# Cloud-Storage-Comparison (AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure)


AWS (Amazon Web Services), GCP(Google Cloud Platforms), and Microsoft Azure are all cloud
computing platforms that provide on-demand computing resources, storage, and services to
help business build, deploy and manage applications and infrastructure in the cloud. They all offer similar services in functionalities such as networking, computing, storage, database, AI and ML and Global reach. The following provides basic information on each of
them. A Cloud platform is a suite of cloud computing services that provides on-demand access to
computing resources, storage, networking, and other IT infrastructure over the internet.

The AWS is the worlds most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud that offers over 200
fully featured service from data centers globally. The AWS was founded by Amazon.com, Inc., by
a team lead by Jeff Bezos (Amazon founder)and Andy Jassy (CEO of Amazon) which was
officially launched in 2006 . The development of AWS began earlier as an internal project to improve Amazon’s own
infrastructure. Over time Amazon realized the potential to offer these cloud computing services
to external customers, leading to the creation of AWS. Now, AWS is the leading cloud computing
platform globally.

Google Cloud Platform is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google. It provides a
wide range of tools and infrastructure for building, deploying, and managing applications and
services in the cloud. GCP leverages Google's global infrastructure, which powers popular
services like Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail, to offer scalable, reliable, and high- performance cloud solutions. GCP was developed and launched by Google in 2008 by the co-founders of google Larry Page
and Sergey Brin and the former CEO of Google Eric Schmidt. Urs Hölzle also played a
significant role in shaping GCP.

Microsoft Azure was developed and launched by the Microsoft Corporation in 2010 as a cloud
computing platform. It was developed under the leadership of the Microsoft executives
including Satya Nadella (Microsoft CEO) and Ray Ozzie (former Chief Software Architect at
Microsoft). Microsoft Azure is a comprehensive cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of
services for building, deploying, and managing applications and infrastructure. It is designed to
support businesses of all sizes, from startups to enterprises, and offers tools for computing, storage, networking, AI, analytics, and more. Below is a brief discussion of its key functionalities:

AWS, Azure, and GCP are the top cloud service providers, each excelling in different areas. AWS, being the pioneer, dominates the market with the most extensive service offerings and global
infrastructure, making it ideal for businesses seeking scalability and versatility. Azure stands out
in the enterprise world due to its seamless integration with Microsoft products and strong
support for hybrid cloud environments. GCP, backed by Google's expertise in data analytics and
machine learning, is favored for data-driven projects and containerization. While AWS is known
for its breadth, Azure for its enterprise-friendly ecosystem, and GCP for innovation, the best
choice depends on the specific needs of the business
